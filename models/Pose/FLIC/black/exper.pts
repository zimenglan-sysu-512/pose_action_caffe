tmask_mid_c4*:
	place the torso mask into conv4 instead of input. and then concat with conv4

	so far, using ground-truth torso bbox to produce torso mask, in which the value is 1 instead of 255
		(1 or 255: the perfomance is not good but similar)
	but the kernel size of conv5 will effect the perfomance
		(1: 78%, 3: 84.8% PDJ@0.1)

tmask_mid_output*:
